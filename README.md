"# EmployeeListDemo" 

The component use webpack, eslint and angularjs.

The latest version of webpak is not stable, so I use @4.2.0 and the webpack-dev-server use version of @3.0.8.


## npm run dev
for the development the environment


### npm run build

for the build code, compress the css, js and html.

### unit test

For the part, I have no enough time to code for this. I work all the week end overtime. I plan to use Qunit.js to test the code.
